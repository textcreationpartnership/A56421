            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>IT hath been in every bodies mouth, <hi>The Parliament were your drudges that you were twice or thrice about to diſcard them ſince they ſat laſt:</hi> No doubt, they ſpake it moſt of them as they would have it. Well, you have broken this Parliament, yea, you have broken your ſelves and us too, yee have turned all topſie turvie. 'Tis true of you, <hi>Theſe are they that have turned the world upſide down: you have made</hi> England, Scotland, Ireland, <hi>a Chaos, without-form and void,</hi> and I doubt your Omnipotency will never ſpeak the word for ſuch a creation, as any ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man ſhall ſay when he hath looked upon it, <hi>that it is very good</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:96694:2"/>You may pardon me ſince you have put all out of Order, if you have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered my thoughts, ſo that I obſerve no method, when all is without any method among us. I tell you, <hi>this action is the moſt faithleſs, ſenſleſſe, bootleſſe, ruinous action that ever appeared upon the Stage of the world: the moſt falſe hearted and traitorous: the moſt ridiculous and inſignificant: the moſt raſh and fruitleſſe: the moſt dangerous and deſtructive adventure that ever men took in hand. Oh my ſoul enter not thou into their ſecrets! nor let any honeſt men ſay a confederacy with them; let them aſſociate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they ſhall be broken to pieces, God will find them out in due time.</hi> I beſeech you what do you mean, are ye Chriſtians and yet will not be men? to paſſe by all former Obligations: did you not the other day <hi>bewail your Apoſtaſie, that you had wandred from your GOOD OLD CA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SE?</hi> did you not tell us, <hi>You took ſhame to your ſelves, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred from whence you were fallen, and repented, and would do your firſt workes; and therefore finding that God bleſſed you all along till you forced the Long Parliament, but after that, made you labour as in the fire, and no good came of all your after actions;</hi> therefore you aſſured them, <hi>that now they ſhould ſit freely, and you would ſtrengthen their hands and be their ſervants.</hi> Is not all this truth in theſe very words, or to this effect, and much more if I had leaſure to repeat; but it is freſh in every bodies mouths and minds, though you have forgot it, and are you not paſt ſhame now: <hi>muſt we bewail your Apoſtacy now,</hi> as fearing <hi>ſince you are fallen away after being enlightned, it will be hard to reſtore you again to repentance; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſince ye have taſted of the powers of this world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But beſides this, did you not every Mothers child of you Officers, did you nor take your Commiſſions from the Parliament, &amp; one by one promiſe your obedience: Yes, that moſt faithful and gifted Brother Colonel <hi>Pac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi> promiſed when he received his Commiſſion at Mr. <hi>Speakers</hi> hands, <hi>that he would not only promiſe them to be faithful and obedient, but they ſhould ſee by his actions that he would be a true ſervant to them and the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</hi> Yea <hi>Lambert</hi> himſelf was the greateſt ſtickler for the Parliament (God forgive him, for what ends I know not) and yet theſe men Act like as they had given the Parliaments Commiſſions, and trurn them out, whom they juſt now promiſed ſo ſeriouſly to obey: a <hi>Turk,</hi> a <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi> would have ſcorned this falſhood and baſeneſſe: What not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               </gap> faithful to our truſt! <hi>O faithleſſe and perverſe Generation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Add to this, that flattering and inſinuating <hi>Petition</hi> and <hi>Repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> but the other day, wherein they ſo ſadly bemoan themſelves <hi>that the Parliament ſhould ſo ſharpely rebuke their humble ſervants, their faithful ſervants, that meant nothing but to petition in a peaceable manner;</hi> where they artificially conceal their intentions for a
<hi>General, only deſire that</hi> Fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woods <hi>Commiſſion may be renewed:</hi> other things they Petition for (we underſtand what your Petitioning ſignifies) <hi>ſome to inſinuate into the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Militia; others to ſecure the Government of the Nation in the hands of the Officers of the Army;</hi> it is ſo in the effect; and the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96694:2"/>moſt Saint-like, promiſe <hi>all to be well-meaning then, to be ſervants to the Parliament;</hi> and the moſt ſweet expreſſions imaginable. But we have tryed them that ſay, <hi>they are Saints, they are the faithful Servants of the Common-wealth, but are not;</hi> and have ſound them Lyars. Who, <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> put the <hi>Northern Brigade</hi> to petition for a <hi>General?</hi> no ſuch matter, he perſwaded them <hi>(good man)</hi> all he could againſt it; yes, I'le warrant you: And yet the <hi>Fift Monarcky-men,</hi> (the Mad ones of them) think now <hi>Chriſts Kingdom</hi> goes on amain, and flock down in Shoals to <hi>Walling ford-houſe,</hi> to make way for <hi>Chriſts</hi> coming; who may be coming for ought that I know, as he ſaith, — <hi>When the Son of Man comes ſhall be find faith upon the earth?</hi> Upon my word, theſe were fit to live <hi>and raign with Chriſt a thouſand years,</hi> who cannot keep Faith an hundred dayes. Let me ſay with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Help Lord, for the Godly man ceaſeth, for the faithful fail among the Children of men; they ſpeak vanity every one with his neighbour; with flattering lips, and with a double heart do they ſpeak.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis a moſt ſenſeleſſe, ridiculous, and inſignificant action; you plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure your Enemies, and make your ſelves and us, the whole Nation, a ſcorn, a deriſion, and a Proverb in the earth. I formerly have been dealing with a Malignant Impoſtor, whoſe whole buſineſſe was nothing elſe but to make you break the <hi>Parliament</hi> to ſerve his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns; for I tell you, they fear their Wiſdome, more then your Power. Are the <hi>Cavaliers</hi> your friends? are ye bewitched to believe them, and to ſlight your old true friends; I thought I needed not to ſay much to anſwer that treacherous <hi>Cavalier;</hi> it was enough to tell you whoſe was the plot, to preſwade you to break the Parliament; ye are cheated into a belief of his impoſture. Ah me! are ye not proud of your wiſdome? Whoſe is this Invention? who put you upon this exploit? Oh ſad! <hi>Will you pleaſe your enemies, and grieve your friends. Know him or them that put you upon this groſs piece of folly, and avoid them. We that put you upon calling back this Parliament, and encouraged you in the day of your ſtraights, and told every body we met, how honeſt the Army would be, now they underſtood themſelves; that they would ſtand by the Parliament, while they did ſettle the Nation upon the foundations of righteouſneſſe and truth: We, even we, are laughed to ſcorn; and I muſt ſpeak to you in the words of Joab;</hi> ye have ſhamed this day the faces of all your ſervants, <hi>that have ſaved your lives, (that have ſaved your credits, which ſhould be as dear as life, and that have appeared for you in the day of your diſtreſſe) in that you love your Enemies, and bate your friends; for you have declared this day,</hi> that you regard neither Princes nor Servants; for this day I perceive that it pleaſeth you well, though all we dye, ſo <hi>Abſalom</hi> live. <hi>We know not how to look any body in the face; though we thought we had done well when we appeared for you, againſt your enemies. But every one of us get away be ſtealth, as people that are aſhamed ſteal away when they flee in Batell;</hi> — <hi>Not only ſo, but you have made your ſelves the moſt abſolute</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:96694:3"/>Changelings <hi>in the world; It is a Proverb beyond Seas, to expreſſe any uncertainty thus,</hi> — As certain as England.</p>
            <p>Our Agent <hi>Lockhart</hi> is laughed at, when he comes to treat with the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Favourite: <hi>What a peace with you! who are your Maſters? you have as many Maſters as Moons: Goe make peace among your ſelves. and then talk of peace with us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ambaſſadors here in <hi>England</hi> know not who to make their Addreſſes to; and have ſaid, <hi>what ſhall we treat? we know not who to truſt to: You will have new Maſters within this Six Weeks, and then we muſt begin again.</hi> This is greatly for your honor; 'tis your interpoſing hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got all theſe changes; ſtill as we have beene ſetling you have broke us to pieces, this is all your wit, you mend the matters wiſely; if we will have any Government to hold, better heads then yours muſt conſult it. I am loth to think 'tis your deſign to unſettle us; if it be, <hi>God help your heads,</hi> you will ſeel the ſmart of it in time, as well as we; you are <hi>good Souldiers,</hi> but <hi>bad ſtatesmen, profeſſing your ſelves wiſe ye are become fools: Be not wiſe over-much,</hi> nor take too much upon you; ye have miſcaryed over and over; will you be doing again? I dread the conſequence of this hair-brain'd Action; and there are ſuch fools in the World, <hi>thought they ſhould be brayed in a Mortar, yet their folly will not depart,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well, but the Parliament muſt out; why, <hi>what evill have they done? for which of all their good works do you ſtone them?</hi> Have they not gone through good report and evil report for the good of the Nation? Was not their hand in all that was done for the aſſerting the Nations Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rights? and where they not carefully providing for us when you firſt turned them out; to ſay, <hi>They intended to perpetuate themſelves, that ſo they</hi> * <hi>might Colour their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation and Tyranny.</hi> Out of your <hi>own mouths I judge you, you evil ſervants;</hi> remember your Declaration, wherein you bewailed your Apoſtaſie. Did they not return to their duties again, to ſerve the publike if poſſible, and forget all your former abuſes? And did they not ſet themſeves ſeriouſly to work for the Nations welfare? and did they not do as much as men could doe, that found things in ſo much diſtraction, to reduce us to better Orders? Yea verily, <hi>they did as much as m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rtal men could doe.</hi> Yea, did they not diſcountenance ſome men more then there was abſolute neceſſity of, to give you content? yea, did they not get you a <hi>whole Years Tax to be paid in Three Months,</hi> and a <hi>Three Moneths Taxe to be paid in Three Weeks,</hi> and all to keep fair with you, and to pay you your due? Did they not prepare an Act for one hundred thouſand pounds <hi>per menſem</hi> to immediately levyed for you; and Orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſell every thing almoſt to pay you your Arrears? and thereby drew an <hi>odium</hi> upon themſelves, more then ever any other Parliament would doe, ſince you firſt turned them out. And yet though men grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at theſe Charges, yet generally hoped the Parliament would make amends by doing good things for them. Yea, did not the Parliament
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96694:3"/>give them new Commiſſions, whom the Protector had caſhiered, without reſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ct of perſons, if they were judged Faithful; as <hi>Lambert</hi> his own ſelf, though a worthy member of Parlament gave good reaſon to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; all without reſpect to their opinions; dealing their reſpect with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out partiality, hoping hereby to oblige their affections? yea did they not encourage all that did the Nation ſervice, and ſhare their Rewards without diſtinction to all that deſerved it; to <hi>Duckenfield</hi> and <hi>Creed,</hi> who deſerve a thouſand times more the reward of a <hi>Rope</hi> for their late Treaſon, then a Chain of Gold for their <hi>Cheſhire</hi> Service: Oh ungrateful unthankful Monſters of Mankind! could it be believed, ſo much diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity ſhould be harboured in <hi>Engliſh</hi> breaſts? Nay I pray heartily, <hi>had you any reaſon to miſtruſt the Par iament?</hi> no more then I have to miſtruſt my own heart: <hi>Have they not been enbarqued all along in the common cauſe with us? is it not as much their intereſt as yours to conſult the ſecurity of the Nation, and all that have been the Parliaments Friends? Yea, is not their life bound up in your life? They could not deſign to ruine the Army, but they muſt ruine themſelves: You were and are as neceſſary by your Forces to defend us, as their Councel to give forth ſuch Orders as may make us happy being ſo defended; and enable us to maintain you as our Guards: When as through want of good advice, if the Commonwealth ſink, (as undoubtedly it muſt without better Counſellors) ye may go and defend</hi> Jamaica; <hi>here will be no uſe of you. Certainly the Parliament cannot be without you, he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides himſelf that thinks they can; they could no more ſettle a Commonwealth without your Arms, then you can without their Heads; neither could they ſecure themſelves, but they muſt ſecure you; nor make any Lawes that ſhould be bad for you, but they muſt be bad for themſelves; which every body thinks they would be as careful in as they could, and no body doubts but they could conſult as well as any company of men that ever were in England:</hi> Yea, and ſay, I ſaid ſo. <hi>Y u muſt call them back again if ever you make any work of it againſt the</hi> Norman <hi>Race.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Go your way then, think upon it: What have you done? certainly, the moſt barbarous, ſavage, and inhumane action that ever was done; it ſeems, <hi>you neither fear God, nor reverence man;</hi> the moſt <hi>brutiſh, child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, wilful, headlong, giddy</hi> Undertaking that ever was put in practiſe And <hi>Wo, aye wo indeed to the Nation whoſe Prince is a Childe:</hi> and no leſſe <hi>wo to that Commonwealth whoſe Rulers are Children.</hi> Yet more, tis the moſt
<hi>bootleſſe, raſh and fruitleſſe Enterpriſe</hi> that ever was introduced by men that could pretend to a deſign: Good now, <hi>What benefit did you propound to your ſelves, or the State? Do you propound no end of your actions? do you not think before hand, what you ſhall ſpeak or do? But do you in that very ſame hour whatever is upon your Spirits?</hi> I doubt, if you have not thought of it before hand, it will hardly be given you ſo ſuddenly, <hi>how to anſwer me aright;</hi> What, <hi>do you overturn, overturn, overturn; and take no care for the Nation, nor your ſelves; what we ſhall eat, or whether we ſhall drink; or whether we ſhall have any cloathes to our backs?

The Second General Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer is an unlucky place; it was <hi>Lieutenant General Cromwell</hi> once, and then he was a Saint, a precious Saint, could preach, and pray, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſtrange matters; then it was —<hi>Is thy ſervant a dog, that he ſhould do ſo and ſo:</hi> what <hi>be Protector, be King, rule by my meer will, no by Gods grace I will never doe it.</hi>

               <hi>The Army would not refer the Nation unto the eare of this</hi> Parliament, <hi>that were, as one ſhould ſay,</hi> Fleſh of their Fleſh, and Bone of their Bone; <hi>ſurely no</hi> Parliament <hi>will ever doe good upon them ſince this could not: If any other</hi> Parliament

            <p>Are there no <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſpirits in the Nation?</p>
            <p>What can you expect, but a general Revolt of the people? and that all the Nation ſhould be in Bloud: Surely it is as good for us to die as to live the Slaves of our Servants, moſt of whom our purſes have raiſed from the dunghil.</p>

            <p>Every thing looks black abour us at home, and abroad; Neighbours

               <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> look at us untowardly, others beſides would put to their helping hand to Ruine us; for all whom we ſhould not have cared Three skips of a Louſe, if you had not diſturbed our SETTLE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT, we ſhould have been <hi>formidable</hi> to all

            <p>All things look with a ſad face, the clouds threaten us from every quarter of Heaven; the Ship of the Commonwealth is now launched out into the Ocean of Confuſion, and it is greatly to be feared, the Voyage will be with hurt, and much damage not only of the Lading and Ship, but alſo of our lives, however the Maſters of our ſhip have perſwaded us that the Haven wherein we were was not convenient to winter in, and have hoiſed ſail intending to run a deſperate courſe and the wind now blowing ſoftly they ſuppoſe they have obtained their purpoſe: but I doubt me it will not be long, ere there ariſe againſt it a tempeſtuous wind, an
<hi>Euroclidon,</hi> which will catch the Ship, that they cannot bear up in the Wind, but muſt let her drive, when if they can come by the Boat, and uſe helps for undergirding the Ship; 'tis well, they may ſtrike ſale, and be driven for fear of the quick-ſands, and to day light the Ship of the Goods, and to morrow caſt overboord the Tackling of the Ship with their own hands.</p>
